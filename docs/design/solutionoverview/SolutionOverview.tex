These extrusions form the "edges" of the cubic housing. %Todo: cite extrusion
    \item \textit{Panels}: Graphite-enhanced expanded polystyrene (GPS) rigid foam insulation panels \cite{insulation} with reflective mylar internal lamination increase energy efficiency (GPS RSI of 0.0328$\frac{m^2 \cdot \degree C}{W}$ per mm of thickness, mylar enables light/heat reflection), as well as safety against cross-contamination and pathogens. Panels slide into extrusion channels and form a "seal" for greater water vapour retention. These panels form the "faces" of cube. %Todo: cite mylar
    \item \textit{Trays}: Horizontal plane subframes mounted to internal vertical extrusion channels for ease of repositioning. Trays slide in/out on permanent mounts.

    \item \textbf{Inputs}: Power, air temperature control signal (\ref{sec:automation}), air circulation control signal (\ref{sec:automation});
    \item \textbf{Outputs}: $\pm$Heat to environment, $\mp$heat to surroundings, internal air circulation, internal air temperature sensor signal (\ref{sec:automation});
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Method}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Testing}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Heat pump direction and magnitude respond to control signal as expected;
        \item Fans operate as expected;
        \item Heat pump power exceeds maximum heat loss (temperature extremes)\footnote{i.e. if X Watts leave the system at MAXÂ°C internal, MINÂ°C external, the heat pump can transfer >X Watts};
        \item Heat pump power exceeds that required to reach temperature extremes in under sixty (60) seconds given the system's heat capacity;
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{Process}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Air is circulated throughout the environment;
        \item Temperature is measured, sent to control module;
        \item Control module controls heat pump speed and direction (heating vs. cooling);
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Calculations}:

Assuming an atmospheric pressure $P$ of 101.325kPa, a surroundings temperature range $T_{surr-min}$, $T_{surr-max}$ of 18-24$\degree$C, a system target temperature range $T_{sys-min}$, $T_{sys-max}$ of 13-30$\degree$C, and a single-housing arrangement (6 faces), a molar mass of dry air\footnote{Water vapour has a maximum concentration of 30g/kg at 30$\degree$C, or 3\%, which is irrelevant for mass and heat capacity calculations.} $M$ of 28.97 $\frac g{mol}$, a specific heat capacity of dry air $c_p$ of $1.006 \frac{J}{g*\text{K}}$ and a 4-unit (2x2) expanded configuration:\\
\vspace{.05cm}
\begin{gather*}
    \label{eqn:heatloss}
    Q_{loss}=\frac{(T_{surr-min}-T_{sys-max}) * A}{\text{RSI per mm} * \ell}=\frac{(22\degree \text{C}-30\degree \text{C}) * (16 \text{ faces} * 0.5\text{m} * 0.5\text{m})}{0.0328 \text{m}^2~  \degree \text{C}~\text{W}^{-1}~\text{mm}^{-1} * 20 \text{mm}}=-48.78 W\\\vspace{.05cm}\\
    \label{eqn:airmass}
    m_{air}=\frac{P*V*M}{R*T_{avg}}=\frac{101325\text{Pa}*(0.5\text{m}*0.5\text{m}*0.5\text{m}*4\text{ units})*28.97\frac g{mol}}{8.314\frac{J}{\text{mol}*K}*300\text{K}}=588.4g\\\vspace{.05cm}\\
    \label{eqn:heatcapacity}
    W_{heating}=\frac{m*c_p*(T_{surr-min}-T_{sys-max})}{t}=\frac{588.4g*1.006\frac{J}{g*\text{K}}*(22\degree \text{C}-30\degree \text{C})}{60\text{ sec}}=-78.92\text{W}
\end{gather*}

$\therefore$ An 80W thermoelectric system will supply enough power to heat/cool the box in 60 seconds AND more than enough to maintain temperature.

    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{Process}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Humidity sensor sends data to control module (\ref{sec:automation});
        \item Dehumidification control signal activates fans and opens shutters;

Assuming an air temperature of 30$\degree$ C, water vapour saturation of $30.4g/m^{3}$, RH of 90\%, target RH of 20\%, and 6\% weight dessicant capacity:
\vspace{.05cm}
\begin{gather*}
    90\% RH = 0.90 * 30.4g/m^{3} = 27.36g/m^{3} \\
    20\% RH = 0.20 * 30.4g/m^{3} = 6.08g/m^{3} \\
    Vol_{4 Units} = 0.5m * 0.5m * 0.5m * 4 = 0.5m^{3} \\
    Mass_{water} = (27.36g/m^{3} * 0.5m^{3}) - (6.08g/m^{3} * 0.5m^{3}) = 10.64g \\
    \frac{10.64}{0.06} = 177.3g \\

\subsection{Optimization}
\label{sec:optimization}

\textbf{Purpose}: Continuously improve yield/etc. of crops as more environment parameter and crop metric data is gathered across iterations.

\textbf{Method}: 

Assume a plant's growth rate (or state change) is related to its current internal state $\vec P \in \R^n$ (for $n$ plant metrics) and the environment conditions $\vec E \in \R^m$ (for $m$ environment parameters). Let these both be functions $\vec P (t),\vec E(t)$ defined at each $t$, where $t=0$ indicates the time of planting. Assume that this relationship is constant for all members of a given species.

Define plant state change $\vec P'$: 

$$\vec P'(t) = \frac{d}{dt}\vec P(t)$$

Define the plant-environment behaviour function $Q$: 

$$Q(\vec P(t), \vec E(t), t)=\vec P'(t)$$ 

Given the current internal and external states, determine the plant's state change.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set $\vec E_{set}(t)~\forall~ t$, aka the program (\ref{sec:automation});
    \item Record $\vec P(t)~\forall~ t$ and $\vec E(t)\approx \vec E_{set}(t)~\forall~ t$ (\ref{sec:environment});
    \item Calculate $\vec P'(t)~\forall~ t$;
    \item Fit $\vec Q$ to our data;
\end{enumerate}

By fitting $\vec Q$ across iterations, we can predict $\vec P$ at any $\vec E$ and $t$. For example:

$$\vec P(t+\Delta t)=P(t)+\Delta t\cdot Q(\vec P(t),\vec E(t))$$

\textbf{Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Machine Learning Model}: Represents $Q$. Operates on the main automation hardware, or in the cloud.
    \item \textit{Environment Sensors}: See Section \ref{sec:automation}. Collects $\vec E$ over time.
    \item \textit{Plant Metrics}: See Section \ref{sec:automation}. Collects $\vec P$ over time.
