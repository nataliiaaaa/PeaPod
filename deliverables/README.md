Documentation for electrical components parts can be found on each part's DigiKey page under "Datasheet".

## Development

BOM downloaded from [DigiKey](https://www.digikey.ca) (can be directly uploaded for ordering). 3D model files are made using [AutoDesk Fusion 360](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/181-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer.html). GCODE files are for the [Prusa MK3S+ MMU2](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/181-original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer.html) using *Prusament PETG* filament. Schematics and PCB files made using [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/).

## Requirements

- Fusion 360 or your 3D editor of choice
- EasyEDA or your PCB/schematic editor(s) of choice
- Excel/Google Sheets or your CSV reader/spreadsheet software of choice
